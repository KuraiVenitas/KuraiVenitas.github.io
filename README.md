## Projects

### Milestone One - Code Review
This Milestone is a Code Review I conducted for my initial version of a mobile app i developed. The purpose of the app is to help a user keep track of their weight daily. The link for the video can be found here: [View Code Review](https://youtu.be/MOylorwhVsM)

### Milestone Two - Weight Tracker App
The artifact that has been enhanced for this milestone is a Mobile App I developed as part of the course requirements of CS-360, involving Android Studio development. The application aims to allow users to enter their weight to keep track of their changes in weight on a day-by-day basis. The user can login to a previously crated account or create a new account where they can then sign in with. I wanted to include this artifact in my ePortfolio because it showcases my ability to create an application using Android Studio, a well-known and widely used application to develop numerous android-based apps. It also shows many core aspects of software development with the inclusion of a local room database, xml layouts and a Java based backend.

### Milestone Three - Course Prerequisite Sorting Tool
The artifact is Project Two from the Cs-300 course. The project required me to take information from a csv and sort the courses and their prerequisites into a hash table, then allow the user to look up information after running the program. I wanted to include this artifact in my ePortfolio because I feel that having a solid grasp on algorithms and data structures is a key aspect of programming across multiple career fields. Having this highlighted in my ePortfolio will be very beneficial for showcasing my skills in that regard.

### Milestone Four - Travlr Trip Booking System (Fullstack Application)
This Artifact is a Fullstack Web development project I worked on in CS-465, a course I took prior to this one. This one focused on making a customer facing page, a single-point admin page and a database to hold user and trip information. Due to the size of the file, it won't be available in it's entirety ;however, I will be including some files I worked on that contributed greatly to its completion.
The following repository will be updated shortly.
