### Milestone Two - Weight Tracker App
The artifact that has been enhanced for this milestone is a Mobile App I developed as part of the course requirements of CS-360, involving Android Studio development. The application aims to allow users to enter their weight to keep track of their changes in weight on a day-by-day basis. The user can login to a previously crated account or create a new account where they can then sign in with. I wanted to include this artifact in my ePortfolio because it showcases my ability to create an application using Android Studio, a well-known and widely used application to develop numerous android-based apps. It also shows many core aspects of software development with the inclusion of a local room database, xml layouts and a Java based backend.
